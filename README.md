A fairy game that I promised to create for my daughter (3 years at the time of writing..) 
if she draws the fairy character herself. She did it, I scanned it, here we go. 

So far there's a blue sky and a small levitating fairy that you can control with the arrow keys.

I'm eating my own dogfood and using Bacon.js, by the way :)

But hey! Just look at the fairy!
