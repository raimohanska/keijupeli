A fairy game that I promised to create for my daughter (3 years at the time of writing..) 
if she draws the fairy character herself. She did it, I scanned it, here we go. 

Current status: we have a cute fairy that you can control with the arrow keys. 
There's also a "spaceman" who's following the fairy. The spaceman is naturally also my daughter's handiwork.

You can check the game online at [keijupeli.heroku.com](http://keijupeli.heroku.com)

I'm eating my own dogfood and using Bacon.js, by the way :)
